# Compliance documentation

**Project:** Operation Signal Forge  
**Nature:** Technical compliance and assurance artifacts — **non-certifying** (not legal advice or regulatory certification)

This folder holds privacy/security-oriented project docs, phase **Compliance Impact Assessments**, and standing guardrails for ZKP and Stage 3.x work.

**Stage 3.5 status:** **CLOSED / PASS** (Gates 5–7). Closure is architectural and verification evidence, **not** production cryptographic certification. Stage 3.6+ runtime proof-path and Authorization Matrix integration remain future work.
